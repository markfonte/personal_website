    titleBlurb: (
      <Box>
        A friend recently remarked that “compromise” is often considered a dirty
        word. For many, it has a negative connotation. It’s associated with
        capitulating to the enemy’s demands; with traitors and treason. While I
        hope that you, the reader, don’t see it in that light, I think that it’s
        critical for us to consider the ramifications of this mindset for those
        that do.

          In Government

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          I remember my middle school social studies teacher, Mr. (Rusty)
          Fuller, remarking that “back in [his] day, people used to actually
          talk to each other in our government”. While it was likely just an
          offhand comment, it has carried weight in my mind for many years. Of
          course, that statement is subject to its biases and of course, the
          government in “his day” had a litany of other problems. Nonetheless, I
          defer judgement to a man who has lived through it both ways and am
          frightened by the obvious polarization in our country these days.
          <br />
          <br />
          Take, for example, the impeachment of Donald Trump. When the House of
          Representatives passed Article I and Article II of impeachment in
          December 2019, Democrats across the country rejoiced in their victory.
          The sentiment was that, even though they knew that the Senate was
          going to acquit Trump, they had won the greater “moral victory”. I
          believe that this was a deeply sad and short-sighted response.
          <br />
          <br />
          Why was I so disturbed by this? Let’s take a closer look at the
          impeachment trial. In the House, not a single Republican voted in
          favor of impeachment in either article. Later in the Senate, there was
          just one Republican who voted in favor of Article I, and not a single
          Republican who voted for Article II. You know what this tells me?
          There were no winners here.

          Some of you might cross your arms and say “well, if you’re right,
          you’re right. That’s what matters!” And therein lies the precise
          problem that I want to address.
          <br />
          <br />
          Let’s start by looking at the positive and negative effects of the
          Democrats actions in the impeachment trial:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h6">Pros:</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          • They were “actually right” based on the evidence (and if you
          disagree with this point, don’t let it distract you from the larger
          message here)
          <br />• Therefore, they feel like they can rest easy knowing that they
          “did the right thing” and are walking with the wind
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h6">Cons:</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" display={"inline"}>
          • They failed to actually impeach him, even though they were “actually
          right” based on the evidence
          <br />
          • 495/496 (99.798%) of Republican votes across both articles and both
          chambers voted AGAINST the impeachment articles that the Democrats
          proposed, even though they were “actually right” based on the evidence
          <br />
          • They set a precedent for future votes in Congress along strictly
          party lines and without compromise
          <br />
          • As the highest lawmakers in the the country, they set a similar
          precedent for the rest of us as well
          <br />
          <br />
          Regardless of who gets blamed for the outcome, they not only failed to
          reach their ultimate goal, but they managed to make things much worse
          for themselves going forward. This was assuming that they were
          actually correct that Trump should be impeached based on the evidence.
          Imagine a parallel situation where they think that they are correct,
          but they actually aren’t - it’s even worse!
          <br />
          <br />
          I can hear your objections. “Why is it the Democrats fault that none
          of the Republicans would listen to their arguments? The Democrats
          still did the right thing here!” The keyword here being “fault,” a
          word of blame.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now we are at a moral crossroads. We can either say: “I give up! I
          know that I’m right, and if other people don’t want to listen, screw
          them! I’m done trying to negotiate with the enemy.” Or we can pick
          ourselves up, take the harder path and start figuring out how to{" "}

          You can choose the easy path. You can say, “this isn’t worth my time.
          These people will never listen.” You can decide that the other side is
          morally reprehensible and that even being seen negotiating with them
          will destroy your reputation. You can decide that to compromise is
          weak and that seeking to understand the other side is making deals
          with the devil. I am naive enough to believe that there is another
          way.

          I choose to follow a different path. I believe that refusing to

          before you even begin. It’s an admission that either your ideas aren’t
          as perfect as you think they are, or you have given up on the ability
          to find good and reason with people whose opinions don’t align with
          yours. And each time someone gives up on the path to understand each
          other and compromise, a piece of our collective humanity dies.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is particularly sad because those in Congress should know better.
          They should know that they need to set an example for the rest of the
          country. If Congress is exactly divided on partisan lines for
          extremely important issues, what the hell do you think is happening in
          the rest of the country?
          <br />
          <br />
          If I was a Democratic Congressperson, throwing insults at or looking
          down on Republicans for “not seeing the truth” would be irrelevant,
          counterproductive, and even morally reprehensible. Whether or not the
          other side has views that you consider hateful, racist and beyond,
          does not mean that 99.798% of the time you should be unable to
          convince them that you are correct. You have a choice. Either you can
          believe in your ability to convince more than 0.202% of people that
          you are correct, or you can believe that 99.798% of the other side is
          fundamentally unable to understand your reasoning and make the right
          choice. Choose the latter, and you are dead on arrival.
          <br />
          <br />
          So I ask again - if you know that you are correct, but you are unable
          to convince anyone who wasn’t already predisposed to believe you, does
          it matter? From a righteousness standpoint, perhaps yes! You can ride
          your high horse of having the “moral high ground” all you want. But if
          your goal is to advance humanity, to make this world a better place
          for everyone in it, to further a culture of listening to each other
          and fighting for the common good, then the answer is a resounding no.
          <br />
          <br />
          To me, the most important thing that any Democrat could have done in
          that situation is to say “hey, I know we don’t agree on a lot of
          things, and I even think your views are pretty hateful! But I want to
          understand why you don’t agree with the evidence being presented. Here
          is what I think, but what do you think about it?” And be eager to
          understand, not to argue or to quit.
          <br />
          <br />
          Because they were unable to convince a single Republican to vote “yes”
          on both articles, I consider it an absolute moral dereliction of duty.
          The ramifications of their inability to compromise only helped further
          the deep divide in our country. It, and many other actions like it,
          will continue to tear our country apart.

          Of course, to sit and talk to people who disagree with you is the
          tougher path. To open yourself up for criticism is the tougher path.
          To seek to understand is the tougher path. To be open to compromise is
          the tougher path. But in the long run it puts us in a position to
          advance society and further the most important issues facing us today.
          I urge you to not give up trying to reach understanding with those
          around you that have completely different views. Don’t let the fear of
          striking out prevent you from even stepping up to the plate.
          <br />
          <br />I choose to believe that even the most hateful and racist people
          are worth talking with and understanding. To stop believing this is to
          give up on them. On us. And I will not give up. When John Lewis and

          same. Do not let their words fall on deaf ears.
          <br />
          <br />
          Do not give up on seeking to understand each other. To help each
          other. Admitting that you are wrong is the ultimate sign of strength.
          Changing your views to reflect new evidence is a sign of strength.
          Compromising for a common good is a sign of strength.
          <br />
          <br />
          And please, if you disagree with me, tell me why I’m wrong. Give me
          new perspectives. Poke holes in my arguments. I am eager to make
          mistakes because it gives me the opportunity to fill in the gaps. But
          I need your help, because I can’t fix problems that I don’t know I
          have.

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Employment contracts in the United States in 2020 are almost
          exclusively “employee-at-will.” Meaning, if the employee wants to quit
          at any point, they are free to do so. If the employer wants to let the
          employee go without cause, they are free to do so (unless a legitimate
          claim can be made that it was an unjust termination of the basis of
          gender, race, etc.).
          <br />
          <br />
          Why do I bring this up? I often find that people talk about their
          employment contracts as if they are legally binding documents that
          force them to work for the company, even if they don’t want to. In
          almost every case, this is not true.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are many things that an employer can do to “force the hand” of
          potential employees (we will get to these later), and one of them is
          getting them to believe that by signing a contract to work with a
          company, they must actually go work for that company. Once you
          recognize that this is just a subtle tactic to tilt the scales in
          their favor, you can begin to resist it.

          “Exploding Offers” & The Stigma Around Reneging
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Different companies can have very different recruitment schedules -
          you might apply for a company that offers you an interview a full two
          months later. For anyone who receives multiple job offers, it stands
          to reason that the first offer they receive doesn’t have to be the
          best offer they can/will receive.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the fall of 2019, I was looking for a full-time software job for
          when I graduated from college the following May. I started by getting
          a return offer from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. at the end of the summer
          (August 9th, 2019). I was given a deadline of October 1st to accept
          the offer, or it would be rescinded.
          <br />
          <br />
          Offers like these are called “exploding offers” and are a tool of the
          oppressor. The problem with an October 1st deadline was that I was
          currently looking for other job opportunities as well. As someone
          looking for a job, it is in my best interest to collect as many offers
          as possible, then decide which one I think is the best fit for me.
          With an exploding offer, the company is trying to get me to sign the
          contract by a certain date so that I stop looking for other,
          potentially much better options.
          <br />
          <br />
          Keep in mind that I wouldn’t start any of these jobs for a minimum of
          eight or nine months at this point. If the deadline to accept the
          offer was, say, a month before I started working, then my case that it
          was a persuasion tool would be significantly weakened. But that is
          certainly not the case here.
          <br />
          <br />
          I can hear you thinking, “Mark, they probably just wanted a decision
          by that date so that they could know their recruiting numbers!”
          <br />
          <br />
          This is not a new argument. First of all, on some level that is a
          valid concern. Businesses need to gauge their recruitment numbers so
          that they can hit their quotas, especially during peak recruitment
          periods. However, this is already a messy problem. Every year, people
          get offers and turn companies down (without reneging, they just have
          better opportunities). Almost every company therefore has some kind of
          policy to extend more offers than they expect to be accepted, or a
          contingency plan like “if person A declines, let’s offer person B.”
          But that’s okay! Their employees are being paid to manage these
          problems, and it’s always a messy situation no matter what. At worst,
          not setting these arbitrary deadlines makes the situation a little
          messier for the company to deal with.
          <br />
          <br />
          There is a difference between if I had gone to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
          and said “hi, I will have an answer for you by October 1st”, and them
          giving me the offer with this “exploding” clause attached to it. In
          the latter case, they are asserting that they are in control and will
          dictate all of the terms in the agreement.
          <br />
          <br />
          Recall that different companies have vastly different recruitment
          timelines and that the <b>first</b> offer someone receives isn’t
          guaranteed to be the <b>best</b>. With J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., I
          asked for an extension of the October 1st deadline, and was given a
          two-week extension until October 15th from the recruiter. Again, I
          didn’t say, “can I have an extension until October 15th?” Rather, the
          recruiter gave me that arbitrary deadline.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, by making excuses for why it is okay for employers to
          arbitrarily rush such an important decision, we are both absolving
          them of blame and closing the door to the possibility that this could
          actually be an underhanded tactic on their part.
          <br />
          <br />
          By October 15th, I was still interviewing and applying for other
          positions, but I wanted to make sure that I had a job when I graduated
          no matter what. I had not considered whether or not J.P. Morgan Chase
          & Co.’s offer was the best offer, because I knew I wasn’t done job
          searching at that point. Because they gave me the arbitrary deadline
          of October 15th, and I wanted to guarantee that I had a job when I
          graduated, I accepted it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Around the same time, I was in talks with Learning A-Z about a return
          offer. I found them honorable in the fact that they didn’t give me an
          exploding offer - they just told me that they would prefer to know by
          a certain date for recruitment purposes. I was happy to respect that

          RetailMeNot gave me an offer in late October, and gave me an exploding
          deadline in November. It wasn’t until November 27th that Amazon
          offered me - but again, they gave me an exploding deadline of January
          3rd.
          <br />

          You can see how circumstances can make it tough to balance doing
          what’s best for the company (like never reneging) and what’s best for
          yourself. The important choice is this: if I had received all four
          offers at the exact same time, what company would I have chosen? My
          answer was Amazon, so I was willing to renege in order to make the
          right decision for myself (and, most likely, the company. Who wants an
          employee that would rather be somewhere else?). It wasn’t ideal, but
          reneging was a tool that I used to make the right decision.{" "}
          <b>
            Had I simply accepted the first offer that I received and been
            unwilling to renege, I would have made the wrong decision.

          Companies Looking Out For Their Own Best Interests, Part Two
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Employers benefit from being the ones to set the terms in these
          employment negotiations. If I was a little more short-sighted or if I
          decided that I was morally against reneging, I would have either 1)
          accepted the offer and stopped looking for others or 2) turned it down
          and taken the chance that I wasn’t employed upon graduation. Neither
          of these were in my best interest. Someone thinking in the short-term
          might think that this tactic is in the best interest of the company.
          It is not.
          <br />
          <br />
          Exploding offers are not in the best interest of either side of the
          negotiation in the long run. As I alluded to earlier, who wants
          employees at their company who don’t want to be there?
          <br />
          <br />
          Imagine a hypothetical where every employee that you hire has their
          full list of potential offers to accept, but they choose your company.
          No rushing them, no mismatched deadlines or underhanded tactics. Now
          you know that, at the very least, your company is full of people who
          wanted to be there. In and of itself, that can be a strong basis for a
          powerful, exciting company culture. That’s the ideal situation. So how
          can we move closer to that ideal?
          <br />
          <br />
          Imagine a hypothetical where a star high school basketball player, say
          Lebron James (he never went to college), is being recruited by
          colleges. A smaller school, say Cornell University, gives him a
          scholarship offer during his sophomore year of high school. The catch
          is, they only give him three weeks to decide. Now, as a sophomore in
          high school, he knows he is pretty good. But he’s not quite sure if
          other schools will want him, and he doesn’t believe that he can risk
          not going to college on scholarship, given his current financial
          situation. So he accepts the offer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now you decide. Was Cornell really looking out for his best interests
          in that hypothetical situation? Don’t you think it might have been
          better if he was able to collect all of his offers, weigh his options,
          then pick the best one?
          <br />
          <br />
          Imagine how grumpy he would have been when he arrived at Cornell,
          knowing he made the wrong decision but didn’t want to back out. Would
          that really have been the best in the long term for Cornell either?
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have to use extracurricular tactics to force your potential
          employees to join your company, you are letting everyone down. You are
          letting the potential employees down because you aren’t looking out
          for their best interests. You are letting yourself down because you
          are admitting that, given all the potential places that Potential
          Employee #1 could get offers from, they would not choose you. So, as
          the company, you do things like: setting an arbitrary deadline for
          them to accept your offer, threaten to rescind it, making them feel
          bad for reneging after you accepted based on their arbitrary
          deadlines. You could even argue that setting the salary and terms of
          employment fall into the same category (why can’t I say, “I will
          accept if you give me $80,000 a year” and then <b>they</b> can counter
          if they want, not vice versa?) but that’s a different discussion
          altogether.
          <br />
          <br />
          A popular way that employers fight back is by threatening to or
          actually blacklisting candidates who renege across their industry.
          This is common in more traditional fields like banking and law, where
          if Potential Employee #1 decides to renege on an offer from Employer
          #1, Employer #1 will tell Employer #2 and every other popular employer
          not to hire Potential Employee #1. Again, this is a negotiation
          tactic. It’s a threat that, “if you step out of line, we will ruin
          your career” and “if you step out of line, we will make an example out
          of you so that nobody else does”. They are looking out for their own
          best interests.
          <br />
          <br />
          These are negotiation tactics that the employers think are in their
          own best interest. Do not confuse their best interests with your own.

          Shifting The Blame To Employees
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          One of the biggest issues I have is the tendency for us to shift the
          blame back to the employees. I believe that chastising your friend for
          reneging isn’t just incorrect; it’s morally wrong. It allows the
          employer to escape the blame while essentially self-policing something
          that is in the best interest of the company.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is a similar tactic that the government and many malicious
          corporations have been using forever, where they get “the people” to
          fight amongst themselves while standing to the side, twiddling their
          thumbs and lining their pockets. Resist the temptation to admonish
          other employees for using any tool that is in their best interest.

          Call To Action
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          I am asking you to consider ways in which people who seem to be
          looking out for your best interests (“but the recruiter was so nice to
          me!” or “they really seemed to care about me!”) might actually not be.
          It can take a critical eye and a few deep breaths to see past the
          smoke and mirrors. That’s the way they want it - it’s in their best
          interest. It’s hard to fight something you don’t even know exists.
          <br />
          <br />
          Next time some entity, employer or not, decides that they are going to
          lay down terms for you before you ever get a chance to say anything,
          stop for a second. Ask yourself, what are they doing here that is only
          in their best interest? What is in mine?
          <br />
          <br />
          I make the assertion that arbitrary exploding deadlines, setting the
          terms of contracts, guilting potential employees into accepting,
          having “nice recruiters”, threatening to or actually blacklisting
          potential employees who renege, and many more are leverage tactics by
          employers. Obviously this is only the tip of the iceberg, but I
          present these examples to illustrate that we need to be on the lookout
          for what employers are doing that might not be in our best interest,
          no matter how they seem at first glance.
          <br />
          <br />I also make the case that, as long as employers are going to do
          what is in their best interest, you must also take steps to do the
          same for yourself. An employer wouldn’t hesitate to fire you, rescind
          your offer, reduce your pay and beyond if that fits their best
          interest. You must be prepared to use the tools (like reneging) at
          your disposal to fight for your own best interests. No one else will.
