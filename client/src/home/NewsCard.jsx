        blurb: <>Eypex Corporation, an automotive supplier and early investor in us at JustLight, performed a hostile takeover using the U.S. court system and their willingness to lie, steal, forge documents, threaten, intimidate and perform illegal acts. Their owner, CEO, head of engineering, and many more spearheaded this effort. They built our first generation product, which was riddled with defects, extremely expensive, and neither FDA nor FCC compliant (and still isn&apos;t)... so we found a much better manufacturer in Light Tree Ventures. With other revenue streams to fund their legal misdoings and an aptitude for vengeance, they filed bogus claims against us in court - then lost, appealed, and waited until they had bled us dry of legal fees and investor confidence. Eventually they bought our assets out of bankruptcy and pretended it was an acquisition. <br /><b>It was not.</b></>,

PBM is the medicinal use of red or near-infrared light for repairing, energising and healing cells in the body without any side effects. The device uses specific wavelengths of near-infrared light to bypass the skull and be directly absorbed by the brain ... Developed in partnership with Kaiyan Medical and Light Tree Ventures, the technology aims to be the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved safe and effective medical device for Alzheimer's in the world.`,
